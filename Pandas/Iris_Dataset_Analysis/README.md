# **Iris-Dataset-Analysis-By-Pandas**

Originally published at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris), this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations. The Iris dataset is based on Iris flower species. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). In the Iris dataset, 4 features were measured from each sample: the lenghth and the width of the sepals and petals. Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

Pandas was used to get some meaningul insights from [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data')

All the problem statements shown below are answered

*Problem Statement 1: Find and print count of each kind of flower (separated by space)

*Problem Statement 2: Find the data of flower “Iris-virginica” type where petal-length > 1.5

*Problem Statement 3: Find and print the minimum, maximum and average value of the feature for each kind of flower
